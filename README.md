# 🪙 SimpleAuction Smart Contract

A simple **on-chain auction system** built with Solidity for learning and demonstration purposes.  
This contract enables users to participate in a basic timed auction using Ethereum (ETH) directly on the blockchain.

## 📖 Project Description

**SimpleAuction** is a beginner-friendly smart contract that demonstrates the fundamentals of building a decentralized auction system on Ethereum.  
It allows users to place bids in ETH, tracks the highest bidder, manages refunds for overbid participants, and automatically ends after a set duration.

This project is ideal for developers who want to understand:
- ETH transactions within smart contracts  
- Safe fund withdrawal patterns  
- Event-driven design in Solidity

## ⚙️ What It Does

1. **Deploy** — The contract is deployed by a seller (the deployer), and the auction lasts for **1 day** by default.  
2. **Bid** — Anyone can place a bid with ETH.  
3. **Refunds** — If a new higher bid is placed, the previous highest bidder can withdraw their ETH safely.  
4. **End Auction** — After the time expires, the seller can end the auction and receive the highest bid.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Fixed 1-day auction duration (no inputs required)  
- ✅ Tracks the **highest bid** and **highest bidder**  
- ✅ Secure **withdraw** pattern to prevent re-entrancy  
- ✅ Emits events for `HighestBidIncreased` and `AuctionEnded`  
- ✅ Fully transparent and verifiable on-chain logic
